### Roles of a Firewall:

- **Packet Filtering:**
  - Examines data packets and determines whether to allow or block them based on predefined rules.

- **Stateful Inspection:**
  - Keeps track of the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.

- **Proxying:**
  - Acts as an intermediary between internal and external systems, forwarding requests and responses to enhance security.

- **Network Address Translation (NAT):**
  - Translates private IP addresses to a single public IP address, hiding internal network structures.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Records network activity for analysis, auditing, and troubleshooting.

- **Access Control:**
  - Controls access to resources based on user identity, IP address, or other factors.

- **Virtual Private Network (VPN) Support:**
  - Facilitates secure communication over the internet by creating encrypted tunnels.

### Firewall Types:

- **Packet Filtering Firewall:**
  - Examines packets and filters them based on predefined rules.

- **Stateful Firewall:**
  - Monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of traffic.

- **Proxy Firewall:**
  - Acts as an intermediary, forwarding requests and responses to enhance security.

- **Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewall:**
  - Translates private IP addresses to a single public IP address, providing an additional layer of security.

- **Application Layer Firewall:**
  - Operates at the application layer, understanding and filtering specific protocols and services.

- **Circuit-Level Gateway:**
  - Works at the session layer of the OSI model, monitoring TCP handshakes.

- **Proxy Server:**
  - Serves as an intermediary between clients and servers, forwarding requests and responses.

- **Stateless Firewall:**
  - Examines each packet in isolation without considering the context of active connections.

These roles and types collectively contribute to the overall security and control of network traffic.
